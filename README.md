# Point of sale
The app is a point of sale, which allows you to manage your small business, offers you the basic features like products, users, sales, purchases and reports.

I take as a base the system created in the Juan Carlos Arcila DÃ­az's course, so you can see [here on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/desarrollo-sistemas-web-php-poo-mysql-jquery-ajax-bootstrap/).

My purpose was to apply my knowledge of php to improve the code base and add more features that I'm glad with.
